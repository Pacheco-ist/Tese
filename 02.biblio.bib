	Abstract = {Modern smartphones are a great platform for Location Based Services (LBS). While outdoor LBS for smartphones has proven to be very successful, indoor LBS for smartphones has not yet fully developed due to the lack of an accurate positioning technology. In this paper we present an accurate indoor positioning approach for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphones that uses the innate ability of mobile phones to produce ultrasound, combined with Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) asynchronous trilateration. We evaluate our indoor positioning approach by describing its strengths and weaknesses, and determine its absolute accuracy. This is accomplished through a range of experiments that involve variables such as position of control point microphones, position of phone within the room, direction speaker is facing and presence of user in the signal path. Test results show that our Lok8 (locate) mobile positioning system can achieve accuracies better than 10 cm in a real-world environment.},

	Abstract = { Operating a crane is a complex job, which requires not only the experience of the operator, but also sufficient and appropriate real-time support to conceive and react to the environment. To help the crane operator, crane pose estimation is necessary to predict potential collisions. Environment perception technologies are essential to update environment information. Location data of the components of the cranes should be used to calculate the pose of the crane that can be used for collision avoidance. This paper aims to investigate how to collect and efficiently process the location data in near real time using ultra wideband (UWB) technology for providing intelligent support to crane operators. First, the requirements of using UWB technology in construction sites to track crane movements are defined. Then, the details of the UWB system setting method are investigated to decide the location of sensors and the number and location of tags attached to different components of a crane. A location data processing method is proposed to improve data quality by filtering noisy data and filling in missing data in near real time. An outdoor test is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed approach. Location data of a crane boom are collected and processed in near real time. The results of the test show a good potential to calculate the poses of crane booms using UWB real-time location system (RTLS). },
