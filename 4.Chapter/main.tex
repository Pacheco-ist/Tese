\fancychapter{Implementation}
\label{cap:implement}


The implementation presented in this paper was created by utilising the generic indoor location system presented in section \ref{cap:architecture} and applying it with bluetooth low energy. The system's architecture is presented in figure ~\ref{fig:implementation} and is divided three parts: the bluetooth low energy device, in section ~\ref{sec:beacon} a description of the used technologies and the changes made are present; the server, whose functionalities and stored information are described in section ~\ref{sec:server}; and the smartphone application, whose process is described in section ~\ref{sec:app} alongside figures that show the functional prototype. For each of these parts an explanation will be given, containing a description of each of its components specific to the presented system alongside the requirements for each to work.
