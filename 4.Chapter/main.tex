\label{cap:implement}


The implementation presented in this paper was created by utilizing the generic indoor location system presented in section \ref{sec:architecture} and applying it with bluetooth low energy. The system's architecture is presented in figure ~\ref{fig:implementation} and is divided three parts: the bluetooth low energy device, in section ~\ref{subsec:beacon} a description of the used technologies and the changes made are present;the server, whose funcionalities and stored information are described in section ~\ref{subsec:server}; and the smartphone application, whose process is described in section ~\ref{subsec:app} alongside figures that show the functional prototype. For each of these parts an explanation will be given, containing a description of each of its components specific to the presented system alongside the requirements for each to work.


This chapter gives an overview of the state of the art of Indoor positining solutions. The \acf{BLE}'s architecture and functionality is analyzed in section \ref{sec:ble}, while section \ref{sec:indoortech} overviews the other existing technologies. The most common techniques utilized for position computation along side examples which make use of them are explained in section \ref{sec:techniques}. Finnally on section \ref{sec:related} analyzes the most projects that had the most relevance in the field and the existing work related to \ac{BLE}.
