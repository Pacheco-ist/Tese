\label{cap:implement}


In this chapter, a detailed explanation of the implemented system will be provided. Figure \ref{fig:implementation} provides an expanded view of the already presented Figure \ref{fig:solution}. In order to implement the system, several decisions were made. Starting with the beacon, the chosen technology was \ac{BLE}, leading to the usage of \ac{BLE}-enabled beacons. This decision is fundamental for defining the software that is to be use for smartphone-beacon communication, in this case being the \ac{BLE} stack. For the map server, the Google maps service was   
used, and as such the map service component of the smartphone was implemented through the Google maps API. The algorithm implemented on the location server was a Cell of Origin (CoO), which was described on Section \ref{sec:techniques}, that made use of beacon information stored onto a database, for calculating positions. This database is represented by the beacon manager component of the location server.
