The web server was implement in Python 3.5 programming language. The program implements a tcp server capable of receiving multiple request at the same time. Each request starts with information sent from an application which includes an undefined amount of pairs of MAC address and associated RSSI value, each corresponding to a \ac{BLE} enabled device that was found and connected. Afterwards the list of pairs is filtered in order to remove any existent devices that are not present in the server's database of devices. Upon extracting all the foreign devices from the list, the locating algorithm is deployed. Once the location has been calculated, a message is sent back to the smartphone with its information.  
 
 
Each server has a database that includes only \ac{BLE} devices. An entry (description of a device) in this database is composed by the device's mac address, its longitude and latitude and its building, floor and room name. In addition to the database, a server can store additional location information such as the server's street, number, zip-code, city and country, allowing it to be transmitted to the client. This offers an additional level of location description to the user.
