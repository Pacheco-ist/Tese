\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:int_outline}

Chapter \ref{cap:indoor} of this thesis examines the state of the art of indoor location systems. It commences with an overview of the current technologies and algorithms for location calculation, passing through examples of existing systems and finalising with a critical overview of all the mentioned subjects.
Chapter \ref{cap:architecture} presents the architecture of the projected generic indoor system by analysing each component according to its responsibilities, while chapter \ref{cap:implement} demonstrates the implemented \ac{BLE} solution based on the previously presented generic architecture. 
To finalise, chapter \ref{cap:Results} shows the experimental tests that were conducted and the associated results.
