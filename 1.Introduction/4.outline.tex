Chapter 2 of this thesis analyzes the technology that's utilized in the implemented solution,bluetooth low energy's architecture and functionality. The different manners of obtain the metrics utilized to obtain an object's position as well as some location algorithms are also reviewed in this chapter, which is finalized by overview existant related work, from the older ones that functioned as reference in the field to more recent work using \ac{BLE}.
Chapter 3 presents the architecture of the projected generic indoor system by analyzing each component according to its responsabilities while chapter 4 demonstrates the implemented \ac{BLE} solution based on the previously presented generic architecture.
