The development of navigation systems began in the 1930's with the second world war and opened the door for a continuous research for better and more precise systems capable of providing real-time locations under any circumstances. The most widely known positioning system is the \ac{GPS}, a system whose development begun in the 70's with a military purpose in mind, and is nowadays available and used by everyone with a capable device, be it a smartphone, a portable \ac{GPS}-device or even a car with incorporated \ac{GPS} system. This passage occored over the last few years with the advancement of technology and allowed it to become more and more something readily available to anyone, which then allowed for outdoor location to become something of our everyday life in the form of navigation systems, with its most widely used application being google maps.

With the \ac{GPS} taking the crown in the outdoor location system due to its incomparable success, the research target changed to indoor location but since it's an outdoor position systems based on a network of satellite, when the required scenario for position tracking is the inside a building, new constraints are presented onto the process such as the attenuation and reflection of electromagnetic waves upon collision with building walls and obstacles \cite{survey2}. As such there was a need to find reliable indoor systems that by nature would already be able to heavily reduce the impact of some of the mentioned constraints.

In order to understand indoor position there is a need to understand the full scope of variables that come to surface when moving from outdoor to indoor. When developing an indoor system there is a need to make sure that it can tackle challenges such as: small space dimension, which reenforces the need for higher precision; a higher probability of non existent line of sight; influence of obstacles such as walls, furniture and moveable objects such as doors and human beings \cite{reviewtechniques}. All of the previously mentioned affect the way electromagnetic waves propagate in an indoor environment leading to problems related to severe multi-path and reflection on existent surfaces \cite{surveywireless}. Besides propagation challenges, there are energy consumption, accuracy and deployment costs that play a critical role in deciding the viability of a proposed indoor location technique.

Indoor positioning systems research has been capable of introducing new technologies other than satellites, whose most relevant characteristic is that they are deployed site-wise and as such have a much smaller range and are capable of at least providing a much clearer line of sight between deployed device and target, which was the hardest obstacle to \ac{GPS} due to the fact that it's a satellite-based system. These smaller scale technologies are meant to be deployed inside building and in much greater number due to their reduced cost. Over the course of the last ten years, the technologies that  were indicated as the ones capable of providing a better indoor location system have been ever-changing as with time the technologies themselves have evolved as well. One of the biggest factors for it has been the evolution of mobile devices which have greatly evolved and have now available a far superior range of different sensors, higher processing capacity and different technologies such as \ac{BLE}, Wi-FI or \ac{RFID}. As such smartphones have made introduced new possibilities to the world of indoor location such as GPS-based technologies, using high sensitivity antennas to overcome GPS's indoor issues, \ac{RFID} , Wireless \ac{LAN} and Bluetooth among others, allowing even for hybrid systems which make use of more than one of the technologies mentioned above. \cite{surveywireless,survey2,survey1}.

This chapter provides an overview of the Thesis. Section \ref{sec:int_motivation} lays out the motivation and the context of the problem being analysed and section \ref{sec:int_state} presents the current state of indoor location systems. The contributions of this work are presented on section \ref{sec:int_contributions} and \ref{sec:int_outline} outlines the rest of the work.
