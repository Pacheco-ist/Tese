The development of navigation systems began in the 1930's with the second world war and opened the door for a continuous research for better and more precise systems capable of providing real-time locations under any circumstances. The most widely known positioning system is the \ac{GPS} \cite{gps}, a system whose development began in the 70's with a military purpose in mind, and is nowadays available and used by everyone with a capable device, be it a smartphone, a portable \ac{GPS}-device or even a car with incorporated \ac{GPS} system. This passage occurred over the last few years with the advancement of technology and allowed it to become widely available to anyone, allowing for outdoor location to become something of our everyday life in the form of navigation systems. 
 
 
With the \ac{GPS} taking the crown in the outdoor location system due to its incomparable success, the research target changed to indoor location. When transitioning from outdoor to indoor, new constraints are presented onto the process such as the attenuation and reflection of electromagnetic waves upon collision with building walls and obstacles \cite{survey2}. Since \ac{GPS} is an outdoor position systems based on a network of satellites, its performance is heavily impacted by these constraints. This created a need for finding reliable indoor systems capable of performing under said circumstances. 
 
 
In order to understand indoor position there is a need to understand the full scope of variables that come to surface when moving from outdoor to indoor. When developing an indoor system, there is a need to make sure that it can tackle challenges such as: small space dimension, which reinforces the need for higher precision; non-existence of line-of-sight; influence of obstacles such as walls, furniture and movable objects such as doors and human beings \cite{reviewtechniques}.When using RF labels, all of the previously mentioned factors affect the way electromagnetic waves propagate in an indoor environment leading to problems related to severe multipath and reflection on existent surfaces \cite{surveythesis}.  
 
 
Besides propagation challenges, there are energy consumption, accuracy and deployment costs that play a critical role in deciding the viability of a proposed indoor location technique. 
 
 
Indoor positioning systems research has been capable of introducing new technologies other than satellites, whose most relevant characteristics are a much smaller range and site-wise deployment, effectively reducing the number of obstacles between the technology device and the user. These smaller scale technologies are meant to be deployed inside buildings and in much greater number due to their reduced cost. Over the course of the last ten years, the technologies that were labeled as the ones capable of providing better indoor location systems have been ever-changing as with time the technologies themselves have evolved as well.  
 
 
One of the biggest factors for it has been the parallel evolution of mobile devices which have greatly evolved and have now available a far superior range of different sensors, higher processing capacity and different technologies such as \ac{BLE}, Wi-FI or \ac{RFID}. Smartphones have introduced new possibilities to the world of indoor location using high sensitivity antennas for \ac{RFID} , Wireless \ac{LAN} and Bluetooth among others, allowing the deployment of hybrid systems which make use of more than one of the technologies mentioned above\cite{surveythesis,survey2,survey1}.
